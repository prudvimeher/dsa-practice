**Topic/Chapter:** Arrays  
**Problem Name + Link:** [LeetCode 66: Plus One](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/)  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Pomodoros Used:** 1  

**Approach Summary (2 lines):**  
Simulated addition from least significant digit using a backward loop. Handled carry propagation manually.  

**Pattern Tag(s):** Simulation, Array Manipulation, Carry Propagation  

**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(n)
